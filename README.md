# Spring-Boot-CRUD-Skeleton
Spring Boot skeleton application with a user data persistence layer for CRUD operations and user authentication

The application is a skeleton I built so that further projects would require less boilerplate
The skeleton comes with an authentication layer, a persistence layer and basic views.
The application.properties file should be changed according to your database preferences

It currently lets you login and add new users when logged in.

I use the thymeleaf templating engine for this one.
